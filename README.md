### What is Rapid Response?

<div class="w-full max-w-none prose prose-lg">

Rapid Response allows grassroots organizations to create and manage hotlines to answer calls (and text messages!) from community members. Dozens of community groups use Rapid Response to provide an open channel for community members to reach real people for help. You and your team of volunteers can log into Rapid Response to forward hotline calls to your phone in shifts and send text messages on the dashboard. We offer the source code to help your group launch your own Rapid Response instance or you can contact us for a hosted cloud version.
