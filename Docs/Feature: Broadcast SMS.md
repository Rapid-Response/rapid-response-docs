# Broadcast SMS - Notifications

### What is Mass Notification?

Mass Notification is a feature of Rapid Response that allows you to send SMS text messages in bulk to many recipients. Essentially, you can broadcast a message to a large number of people using Mass Notification. Using this tool to communicate with an audience is a great option if the audience is particularly large (over 500 people) because the mass notification tool can deliver the text to each contact within seconds. 

>*Note: Mass Notifications rotate 3-5 other phone numbers to send the messages to recipients. The feature does not use your Hotline number to send out SMS. Receipts of SMS text messages sent through Notifications cannot reply to the message.*
