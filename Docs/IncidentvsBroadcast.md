# Incident vs Broadcast

## What are the two features?

Incident Report and Text Notification are two ways you can send SMS text messages to an audience. It's important to understand which feature is most appropriate for your use case. One is used to send Alerts to contacts near a specific address, the other to a mass audience that you select.

| **Incident Report** | **Text Notification** |
|----|----|
| Incident Reports is a feature used to send SMS text alerts to selected audiences about an ongoing event happening at a specific location. | Notifications is a new premium feature* used to broadcast SMS text messages to selected audiences A notification is a mass text broadcast. That is a one-to-many text. |

### Which one should I use?

We recommend using the Incident Reports whenever there is an immediate need for legal observers at a specific address. For example, an ICE raid or Emergency incident that needs rapid responders that have zip codes near the location of the incident.Â 

We recommend using Text Notifications whenever there is a need to send information to a large group of contacts. For example, you need to send your 2k+ DACA audience about a legal clinic being offered at the local community center.
