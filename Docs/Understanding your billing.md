# Understanding your Billing

### Twilio & Rapid Response

To better understand your hotline billing information, you must understand the relationship between our software and Twilio.

Rapid Response is an application platform built on top of Twilio. Twilio is a communication service provider, just like Sprint, T-Mobile, and AT&T. Rapid Response provides you with a simpler interface to send SMS texts and calls through Twilio's services. You can think of Rapid Response as your phone device and Twilio as your phone carrier. And just like your phone carrier, text messages and calls cost money.
