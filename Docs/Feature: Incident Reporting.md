# Incident Report

Incident Reporting is one of our core features that help grassroots organizations and teams deploy a coordinated response to situations happening in the community. Many teams use this feature to send targeted messages to legal responders to respond to an emergency incident (like ICE raids).

### How it works

The Incident Reporting feature works by creating an Incident Report with the location of the situation. Then, you are able to send an SMS message to an audience within a radius around the location of the incident. 

**For example;** The hotline receives a call from a concerned community member who just witnessed a possible ICE Raid. Your hotline operator then creates a report and chooses to send a text message to legal observers that are within 5 miles of the location of the incident. 

> Note: Locations are based on provided Zip Codes rather than Geo-Location Data from cellphones. Rapid Response does not track any location data from anywhere.
