This area is where you can edit and change the Name and Description of your hotline. This is helpful when you have multiple hotlines and need to distinguish each from the other.

**Note: Legal Compliance for custom greeting message**- Custom greetings may require a recording disclaimer to comply with your state's laws about privacy and record keeping. We encourage users to include the following sentences when creating the call recording: "This call may be monitored and recorded for quality or training purposes."

### Catchment Area

A catchment area is a geographic area from which your hotline attracts callers. For example, if your hotline services the area of San Diego County, you would select San Diego as your catchment area.

**Note:** A catchment area helps you better manage your Rapid Response account. For example, selecting your catchment area in advance helps you type ahead quickly the address of an incident you want to report in the Incident Report tool.
