# Audiences

### What is an audience in Rapid Response?
An audience is a group of contacts who share the same tags.

### What can I do with audiences?
You can communicate with audiences using two different tools on Rapid Response; [Mass Notifications](https://rapid-response.helpscoutdocs.com/article/76-mass-notifications), the [Incident Report](https://rapid-response.helpscoutdocs.com/article/75-incident-reporting).

>Note: Before you and your team begin to use your Rapid Response account, we recommend Dashboard Administrators create Audiences.
