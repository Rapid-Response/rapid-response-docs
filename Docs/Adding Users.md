## Re-sending Sign-up Emails

Sign up emails expire after 48 hours for security reasons. If your new user doesn't receive a welcome email within five minutes of being added to your account, ask them to check their Junk/SPAM folder. If the new user has not received an email, you can click the "Resend Verification Email" message in their profile.
