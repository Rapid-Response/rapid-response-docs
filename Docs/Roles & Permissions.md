# Roles & Permissions

When you add a new user to your Rapid Response account, you must assign them one or more roles. This article explains the three roles a user can be assigned in Rapid Response.

## 1. Dashboard Administrator

Users with the role Dashboard Administrator have the most control in your Rapid Response account. The most important permissions given to Dashboard Administrators are the ability to add and remove new users and the ability to add additional phone numbers to the Rapid Response account. We recommend keeping the number of users with the Dashboard Administrators role low because it has such important permissions.  

### Permissions

* Can Add, Update, and Deactivate Users as well as perform the following actions.
  - Resend verification emails.
  - Resend verification texts.
