# Catchment Areas

ðŸ“¢ Reminder: Before you get started with Rapid Response, we recommend you select the catchment area for each of your hotlines.

## What is a catchment area in Rapid Response?

A catchment area is a geographic area from which your hotline attracts callers. For example, if your hotline services the area of San Diego County, you would select San Diego as your catchment area.

## Why is having a catchment area important?

A catchment area helps you better manage your Rapid Response account. For example, selecting your catchment area in advance helps you type ahead quickly the address of an incident you want to report in the Incident Report tool.
