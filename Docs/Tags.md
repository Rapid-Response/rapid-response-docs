# Tags
 Tags help you and your team label and describe different aspects of your software. For example, you can make better sense of the kinds of calls you receive by creating labels that operators can use to describe the call he or she received.
 
 > Before you and your team begin to use your Rapid Response account, we recommend Administrators create tags for different components of your account.
