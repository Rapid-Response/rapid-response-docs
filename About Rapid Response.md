### Our Story

In late 2016 undocumented people in tech and law created the Rapid Response app for grassroots organizations to host a distributed hotline system and SMS text dispatching service to manage community responses to ICE raids in real-time.The app quickly took off in multiple cities across the country within weeks following the inauguration of President Donald Trump. In 2017 multiple organizations and coalitions were created using Rapid Response to connect with community members experiencing an ICE raid and deploy a coordinated response to the situation.

The impact was immediately felt during the first major wave of ICE raids under the Trump Administration. Organizations using Rapid Response were able to respond to thousands of people who were experiencing ICE raids and were able to provide immediate legal and community support. In August 2017, the Rapid Response app helped community members in the Bay Area expose the abuses of ICE and local police when it was used to bring legal observers and attorneys to the scene of an ICE raid in Oakland, California (story). It resulted in greater transparency among those in local communities. The work of our users has been featured in USA Today, Mother Jones, the New York Times, and countless local news publications. 

Rapid Response has been used by more than 42 organizations to operate their ICE response networks, including the management of more than 9,000 volunteer legal observers. In 2020 users will receive a new version of Rapid Response to scale their efforts. 

In 2020, due to COVID-19 pandemic, Rapid Response became a generalized software for organizations that need hotline and texting services to help communities. Organizations pivoted and began using the app to help undocumemented immigrants access financial services.

The Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network began using their Rapid Response software to manage a team of hotline volunteers to help immigrants apply for financial relief from the State of Washington. The app has been used by the local government to provide direct aid to community members with COVID19. Today, more and more organizations are using Rapid Response for diverse use cases that require hotline and texting services.
