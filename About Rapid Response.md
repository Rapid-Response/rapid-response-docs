### Our Story

<div class="w-full max-w-none prose prose-lg">
In 2017 undocumented people in tech and law created Rapid Response for grassroots organizations to host a distributed hotline system and SMS text dispatching service to manage community responses to ICE raids in real-time. The app quickly took off in multiple cities across the United State and multiple organizations and coalitions were created using Rapid Response to connect with community members experiencing an ICE raid and deploy a coordinated response to the situation.

The technologyâ€™s impact was immediately felt during the first major wave of ICE raids under the Trump Administration. Organizations using Rapid Response were able to respond to ICE raids and were able to provide immediate legal and community support to impacted immigrants.

>In August 2017, the Rapid Response app helped community members in the Bay Area expose the problematic interagency practices between the local ICE office and law enforcement when it was used to bring legal observers and attorneys to the scene of an ICE raid in Oakland, California (story).


Rapid Response has been used by more than 42 organizations to operate their ICE response networks, including the management of more than 10,000 volunteer legal observers and responses to more than 1000 ICE raids.

>In 2020, due to COVID-19 pandemic, Rapid Response became a generalized software for organizations that need hotline and texting services to help communities. Organizations pivoted and began using the app to help undocumemented immigrants access financial and medical help.

>The Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network began using their Rapid Response software to manage a team of hotline volunteers to help immigrants apply for financial relief from the State of Washington. The app has been used by the local government to provide direct aid to community members with COVID19. Today, more and more organizations are using Rapid Response for diverse use cases that require hotline and texting services. 


In early 2022 the Rapid Response entered a new stage: becoming an open source software available for any community organization to self-host on their own servers. The founders also continue to provide hosting to its existing users and new groups interested in getting technical support to manage their hotlines.
